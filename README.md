# RPG Campaign Writing Collection

This repository contains my tabletop role-playing game (RPG) campaign materials, organized by game system. The collection serves as both a creative archive and a working resource for ongoing and future campaigns.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on game systems/settings:

- **Planescape/** - Materials for Planescape (D&D) campaigns
- **Shadowrun/** - Materials for Shadowrun cyberpunk fantasy campaigns  
- **Rifts/** - Materials for Palladium's Rifts multi-genre setting

Each game system directory follows a consistent structure:

```
GameSystem/
├── The_Cast.md       # Character profiles and NPCs
├── Locations.md      # Setting locations and descriptions
├── Plot_Hooks.md     # Adventure and story ideas
├── Sessions/         # Session notes and summaries
└── Resources/        # Maps, handouts, and reference materials
```

## File Format and Conventions

All writing is maintained in Markdown (.md) format for:
- Maximum portability
- Version control efficiency
- Easy conversion to other formats
- Lightweight editing on any device

### Naming Conventions

- Files use underscore_separated_names.md
- Directory names use PascalCase
- Document titles use Title Case within the files

## Usage Guidelines

### Character Profiles (The_Cast.md)

Character profiles follow this template:
```markdown
## Character Name
**Role:** [Character's role in the story/party]
**Background:** Brief background information
**Motivation:** What drives the character
**Connections:** Relationships with other characters/factions
```

### Locations

Location descriptions include:
```markdown
## Location Name
**Region:** [Where this is located]  
**Description:** Physical description
**Notable NPCs:** People found here
**Secrets:** Hidden elements players may discover
```

## Workflow

1. Initial ideas and drafts are added to appropriate files
2. Campaign notes are updated after each session
3. Changes are committed with descriptive messages
4. Repository is periodically backed up

## Tools

- Visual Studio Code with Markdown extensions
- Git for version control
- Markdown preview for rendering
