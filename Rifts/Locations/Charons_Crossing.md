# North and South Charon's Crossing

The town of Charon's Crossing is actually more like two towns, split east-west by a large river, referred to as the River Styx.  They maintain a ferry between the two towns, which is the primary means of travel between them.  It is a frontier town, miles from other communities.  A ley line travels upon the river for some distance, including between the two settlements.  This gives the river strange and supernatural qualities.

## Notable Individuals
- **Garrick** ==`Principled 8th level Operator OCC`== -- Gruff, but hard-working and talented engineer who takes care of the settlement's many repairs and construction projects.
- **Charon** ==`Aberrant 10th level Ley Line Walker OCC`== -- Enigmatic and transactional ferryman that takes care of transport and protection across the river, among other mysterious things.  Ostensibly the founder and foundation of the community's functioning.
- **Amaria** ==`Principled 9th level Mystic OCC`== -- The director of magical projects for the settlement, along with its supernatural protection and education.  She is kind and wise and patient, with a particular care for the children.
- **Rex** ==`Unprincipled 8th level Shifter OCC`== -- A reclusive who lives at the fringes of the community, near the nexus and acts as something of a vanguard against extra-dimensional incursion and dangers.  The community regards him as suspicious and somewhat of a pariah.
