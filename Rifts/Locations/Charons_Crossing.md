# North and South Charon's Crossing

The town of Charon's Crossing is actually more like two towns, split east-west by a large river, referred to as the River Styx.  They maintain a ferry between the two towns, which is the primary means of travel between them.  It is a frontier town, miles from other communities.  A ley line travels upon the river for some distance, including between the two settlements.  This gives the river strange and supernatural qualities.
