I will be making an effort to remain faithful to the game and setting mechanics for the current Shadowrun Sixth World (6th Edition) system in creating and portraying the characters.  

# Protagonist Characters

**Victor** -- Male human mystic adept.  Spirit mentor is the Seducer, referring to themselves as Asmodeus.  

**Sudo** -- Male human technomancer.  

# Support Characters

**Asmodeus** -- Victor's mentor spirit.  His archetype seems to be like the Seducer's, except his true nature remains a mystery.  It is often suggested that he is a devil, though it remains ambiguous and unconfirmed.
