if things have to be real
why bother having to feel

so much meaning under the sun
to living life and having fun

the path to feeling sane
is to call perfect the profane

time burns the world in friction
chaining it with addictions

does love lie behind surrender
or are we all pretenders

a thin layer between
what's hidden, what's seen

what's the use of meaning
if meaning is just a mask

words to fill the silence
questions no one asks

to want is to remember
to need is to forget

the ache of empty longing
the comfort of regret

until our final breath
