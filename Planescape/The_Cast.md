I will be making an effort to remain faithful to the game and setting mechanics for the current D&D Fifth Edition system in creating and portraying the characters.  

# Protagonist Characters
**Glenn** -- Male human cleric.  Domain of Light.  

**Razafizle** -- Male tiefling wizard.  Order of Scribes.  His familiar is a mimic that is also his spellbook, which he simply calls "Book".

**Spindel** -- Female aasimar rogue.  Arcane Trickster.  

**Tobin** -- Male bariaur barbarian.  

**Box** -- Rogue modron bard.  College of Lore.  

# Supporting Characters
**Dolores** -- Female human sorceress.  Her true nature and the extent of her abilities is unknown.  She has some power over portals, sensing their presence and connections, even able to open many of them without keys.  She is a product of Estephab's magic combining blood from Aoskar and other planar artifacts.  Her contact with planar keystones gives her power related to that plane, including the ability to change or make portals connected to them.

**Book** -- A mimic of above average intelligence for one of its kind.  Having consumed a book, he can mimic the contents, including any spellbook.  However, this has led to it being limited in its ability to mimic other objects, books being easiest of course, and other things that are roughly book-sized (for a limited time).  It does not understand its own contents, nor could it cast spells, were it able to read itself.  Its thoughts are predatory and hungry, alert and calculating, with a taste for knowledge and magic.
